                    I started programming while I was pursuing my degree in Electrical Engineering
                    at <InlineLink 
                    children="San Diego State University"
                    href="https://electrical.sdsu.edu"
                    />. I tinkered around with HTML & CSS, but focused on C, Java, and Python. It wasn't until I graudated that I started
                    to dive deeper into web development and began teaching myself.
                    <br/><br/>

                    Since then, I've gotten the opportunity to work in a variety of positions where I've had the chance to
                    work with <InlineLink href="https://www.raveon.com/" children="radio devices" />
                    , <InlineLink href="https://www.ayahealthcare.com/" children="travel nursing" />
                    , and now with web and mobile <InlineLink href="https://drugdevelopment.labcorp.com/" children="applications used in clinical trials" />.

                    My favorite hobby is playing video games. I grew up with Playstation consoles, but now I also 
                    play on my PC. But when I'm not at my desk, I like to visit the beach,
                    play <InlineLink href="https://www.varsitygayleague.com/" children="kickball"/> on weekends,
                    and spend time with loved ones.

                    Here are some technologies I have experience with:
                </p>
                <SkillList />
            </div>
            <div className="About-right">

        </div>
    )
